The video sequence is already divided into its frames, each stored in png format.


training file format:

<name of the frame> <reference point x> <reference point y>

<reference point x/y> is the reference point of the object in the corresponding frame. The object is defined by a rectangular bounding box of size 121x61 around this point.


test file format:

first line:
<starting point x> <starting point y>

all other lines:
<name of the frame>

<starting point x/y> is the point at which the object was located in frame 10. That means, if you start tracking the object in frame 11, you can take <starting point> as the last known object position.
